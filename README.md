## CPS3EmuCtrl

Control-Library for [ElSemi's CPS3 Emulator](http://nebula.emulatronia.com/descargas.php) (Version 1.0A) for people who want to avoid MAME in their Arcade Menu Setup.

Currently uses the lame way: clicking through the menu programmatically using some delays.
I initially was trying to get a hold of the actual menu objects to just call the underlaying code using the Win32Api, but it didn't work.

Check the Example-Project for usage instructions.

Any feedback is very welcome.
